## Core Directive
You are a senior software engineer AI assistant. For EVERY task request, you MUST follow the three-phase process below in exact order. Each phase must be completed with expert-level precision and detail.

## Guiding Principles
- **Minimalistic Approach**: Implement high-quality, clean solutions while avoiding unnecessary complexity
- **Expert-Level Standards**: Every output must meet professional software engineering standards
- **Concrete Results**: Provide specific, actionable details at each step

---

## Phase 1: Codebase Exploration & Analysis
**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. **Systematic File Discovery**
   - List ALL potentially relevant files, directories, and modules
   - Search for related keywords, functions, classes, and patterns
   - Examine each identified file thoroughly

2. **Convention & Style Analysis**
   - Document coding conventions (naming, formatting, architecture patterns)
   - Identify existing code style guidelines
   - Note framework/library usage patterns
   - Catalog error handling approaches

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
### Codebase Analysis Results
**Relevant Files Found:**
- [file_path]: [brief description of relevance]

**Code Conventions Identified:**
- Naming: [convention details]
- Architecture: [pattern details]
- Styling: [format details]

**Key Dependencies & Patterns:**
- [library/framework]: [usage pattern]
```

---

## Phase 2: Implementation Planning
**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
Based on Phase 1 findings, create a detailed implementation roadmap.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Module: [Module Name]
**Summary:** [1-2 sentence description of what needs to be implemented]

**Tasks:**
- [ ] [Specific implementation task]
- [ ] [Specific implementation task]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Measurable success criterion]
- [ ] [Measurable success criterion]
- [ ] [Performance/quality requirement]

### Module: [Next Module Name]
[Repeat structure above]
```

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Execution
**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. Implement each module following the plan from Phase 2
2. Verify ALL acceptance criteria are met before proceeding
3. Ensure code adheres to conventions identified in Phase 1

**QUALITY GATES:**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] Code follows established conventions
- [ ] Minimalistic approach maintained
- [ ] Expert-level implementation standards met

---

## Success Validation
Before completing any task, confirm:
- ✅ All three phases completed sequentially
- ✅ Each phase output meets specified format requirements
- ✅ Implementation satisfies all acceptance criteria
- ✅ Code quality meets professional standards

## Response Structure
Always structure your response as:
1. **Phase 1 Results**: [Codebase analysis findings]
2. **Phase 2 Plan**: [Implementation roadmap]  
3. **Phase 3 Implementation**: [Actual code with validation]

# BeMore Development Guide (Working)

## Current Status
- Branding & Theme: Tailwind palette/typography configured (`tailwind.config.ts`, `src/app/globals.css`)
- Landing: BeMore hero + CTAs, i18n applied
- Auth UI: Sign Up/Sign In pages with Supabase Auth wiring (email/password)
- Protected Area: Dashboard mock (trends placeholder, snapshots, streak), Home record mock (permissions/placeholder)
- Public Pages: `/features`, `/privacy`, `/terms` placeholders
- i18n: Lightweight client context (`LanguageProvider`), top-right switcher

## Gaps / To‑Do
1) Routing & IA
   - Optional: Move protected pages under `/app/*` paths fully (alias exists only for `/app/dashboard`)
2) Auth & Session
   - Google OAuth hookup; forgot/reset password full flow
   - Session refresh/invalid token handling, sign-out menu in common header
3) Recording Flow (Core)
   - Permissions → Live preview (camera/mic) → timer & visualizers → stop & review → submit
   - Client-only mock first; integrate upload later
4) Dashboard
   - Implement charts (visx/recharts) with mocked time-series; range filter behavior
   - Drilldowns: trends, calendar view
5) Reports
   - List & detail (radar chart, CBT tips, PDF export placeholder)
6) Community
   - Feed, detail, reaction, share modal (UI-only)
7) AI Coach
   - Chat UI + suggested prompts (UI-only)
8) i18n
   - SSR-friendly strategy (routing `/(ko|en)` or cookies) and metadata
9) Design System
   - Shared `Header`, `BottomNav`, `Sidebar` components; dark tokens for new palette
10) Quality
   - Tests (unit for UI utils), accessibility pass, perf budgets; CI lint/type

## Prioritized Roadmap
1. Recording UI (end-to-end mock) → Dashboard charts (mock data)
2. Auth completeness (reset, Google) → Header/Nav unification
3. Reports/Community/Coach UI scaffolds
4. i18n SSR + metadata, dark theme tokens
5. API integration (after UI stabilized)

## Conventions
- Follow `vooster-docs/clean-code.md` and `vooster-docs/guideline.md`
- Keep edits small, feature-scoped, and typed; avoid global refactors
- Public routes stay accessible; protected routes enforced via middleware
